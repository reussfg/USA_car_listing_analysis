# USA Car Listing Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook contains an analysis of car listings in the USA. The analysis aims to identify factors that influence the price of a car.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `a6f1fac8-5539-4ed8-a8ec-22cc39f2bad7 (1).ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to reproduce the analysis.

## Data Source

The data used in this analysis was obtained from a publicly available dataset of car listings in the USA.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis includes the following steps:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and evaluation

## Results

The analysis found that several factors, such as car make, model year, and mileage, have a significant impact on the price of a car. 

## Future Work

Future work could include:
- Incorporating additional data sources to improve the accuracy of the model.
- Analyzing the impact of geographic location on car prices.
